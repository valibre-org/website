# With the support of Web3 Foundation Grants Program ❤️ 

Virto team is glad to announce the completion of the initial development of its
[`payments pallet`][pallet], a payments primitive that enables any blockchain
in the [Polkadot][polkadot] and [Kusama][kusama] ecosystems deliver a simple
and secure experience when paying for real world goods and services.

>flagship project.*

**Virto Network** aims to build the best decentralized infrastructure for
marketplaces with local impact in the Polkadot ecosystem. To ensure the success
of marketplaces, it's Virto's responsibility and pursuit to provide
marketplaces with secure and convenient payment system. With this goal and
expectation **Virto Payment Pallet** was born. 

**Virto Payment Pallet** tries to tell people a story of trust, which starts
with **trustless**. Imagine you want to start your own business, what would be
the most challenging part? Many answers may already come to mind, among which
the word **trust** appears often. For example, how could you build the trust
with your business partners? How could you gain trust from your customers every
time they purchase from you? How could your trust other services and goods
whenever you buy? We know it's not easy to start with just naive trust, that's
why Virto purpose to build the Payment Pallet with the trustless design. People
could pay each other easily using the pallet. The payment from buyers will
always be locked first and only be released to sellers once the buyers
confirmed to have received the product or services. The payment pallet also
allows the creator of the payment to trigger cancel with a buffer time and the
recipient to dispute the payment request of sender.   

How does Virto Payments Pallet achieve the desired functionality? As the
fundamental part of [LIP][lip], it's an escrow like system that allows people
pay with cryptocurrency for any product or service from the real world, it has
been redesigned from the ground up to be highly configurable to serve the needs
of the Virto Network as well as any other Substrate based chain that wants to
engage with real-world assets.

We are very excited about what this milestone represents for the future of
Virto Network, payments pallet is just the first step in our path towards
making blockchain technology usable in the day to day live of common users and
making _decentralized commerce with social impact_ the default way of conducting
buissiness in the world of Web3. 
Now it's the time to showcase together with our first partners what the world
of interoperable decentralized marketplaces will look like and how this
technology can help on-board a new wave of non technical users, first to Kusama
and soon after to the rest of the Polkadot ecosystem.
